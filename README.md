/lib
├── /application
│   ├── /controller     # Business logic and state management
│   ├── /model         # Weather data models
│   ├── /presentation  # UI components and screens
│   └── /service       # API calls and remote data handling
├── /core              # Core 
└── main.dart          # Application entry point
```
